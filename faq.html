    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>How do I start generating teams for my class?</strong></p>
    <p>You have to first get your course information imported into the
	app, then elicit the necessary preferences from your students, specify any
	project needs you may have, and then you can generate teams. Follow the
	stepper at the top of the app from left to right to walk through each of
	these steps one at a time.
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I import my course information into the app?</strong></p>
    <p>Go to Step 1 labeled "Sections". If you haven't already done
	so, the app will ask you to import the sections and students into the app.
	If you're not sure, you can always import the data again. Also, if you
	think you have new students who registered late to your course, you can
	click import again and that student will also be added to the app.
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I view the list of students in the course?</strong></p>
    <p>Go to Step 2 labeled "Students". All the imported student
	information will show up there. You can always come back to this tab after
	the teams are formed to search which team a particular student belongs to.
	</p>

    <p><strong>What are attributes?</strong></p>
    <p>"Attributes" is the generic term we use to refer to the types of
	information that you may wish to elicit from students. These include:
	personal traits, attitudes, demographic information, characteristics,
	expertise, friends preferences, enemies preferences, time slot
	availability, and project preferences. Once you have defined the
	attributes you want to use, you can add them to the survey and ask your
	students to complete the survey. Similarly, if you want to match students
	to projects based on their expertise, you can add the expertise-related
	attributes as the projects requirements.
	</p>

    <p><strong>Why do attributes have question text?</strong></p>
	<p>Since attributes are being used as part of a survey for eliciting
	information from students, you will need to write out the question text
	that the students will see for that attribute.
	</p>

    <p><strong>What is an answer group in an attribute?</strong></p>
	<p>Since attributes are being used as part of a survey for eliciting
	information from students, an attribute has a question and possible
	answers that students may respond with. Our app comes with some commonly
	used answer groups so that you can use them if you like. If you create a
	new answer group, you can also use it at a later time for another
	attribute without having to re-define all the details again. Note that for
	privacy reasons, some students may not wish to answer sensitive questions.
	In these cases, we suggest you include an option for "Prefer not to say".
	</p>

    <p><strong>I am not sure which attributes to use or how to define them.
	Are there any examples I can use?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, when you go to Step 3 labeled "Attributes", you will see at the
	bottom there is a "List of Available Attributes to Import". These are
	the commonly used attributes that we found in the research. You can view
	them to see if you want to use them as part of your elicitation process.
	After you import them, you can also modify them.
	</p>

    <p><strong>I want to build teams based on student gender, which I'm fairly
	sure is information that the Canvas learning management system already has
	about the students. Do I still need to create an attribute for this?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, you need to create an attribute for all the information you wish
	to elicit and use to generate teams. Aside from the student name, the
	student ID, and the course section, we do not get any other student
	information from the learning management system. While it may save you
	more time if we do grab basic student information, we believe it is
	important to that students know exactly what information is being gathered
	about them. 
	</p>

    <p><strong>What if I don't have projects in my course but I still want
	students to work in teams?</strong></p>
    <p>You can skip the "Projects" step since this information is
	optional.
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I define the projects that I need to assign a team to? </strong></p>
    <p>xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>What if I want to assign multiple teams to a project?</strong></p>
    <p>You can first define the project, then clone it, and give it a
	different name. Then when you generate teams, one team will be assigned to
	the original project and another team will be assigned to the cloned
	project.
	</p>

    <p><strong>Can I modify project requirements after the teams have been
	generated?</strong></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, once the teams have been generated, you cannot
	modify the requirements. If you need to change the projects, you will need
	to create a new project set with new projects, and then re-generate the
	teams.
	</p>

    <p><strong>Why do I have to build surveys?</strong></p>
    <p>The purpose of the survey is to help you elicit student
	characteristics and preferences. If you have already created all the
	necessary attributes that correspond to information you wish to elicit
	from your students, you can simply add them to the survey.
	</p>

    <p><strong>Will students use this app to answer the survey?</strong></p>
    <p>No, once you are done building the survey, you can publish it
	in the learning management system. In Canvas, the published survey will
	show up as a quiz. Students can complete the quiz in Canvas. </p>

    <p><strong>something about Generate teams</strong></p>
    <p>xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I know which algorithm to use when I generate teams?</strong></p>
    <p>xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>How should the parameters of the weight algorithm be defined?</strong></p>
    <p>xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>How should the parameters of the priority algorithm be defined?</strong></p>
    <p>xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>How should the parameters of the social algorithm be defined?</strong></p>
    <p>xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>Where can I see the generated teams?</strong></p>
    <p>In Step 6 labeled "Teams", you can see "List of Team Sets" that have
	been generated in your course.
	</p>

    <p><strong>Can I compare two sets of teams that I generated at different
	times?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes. When you view a set of generated teams, you will see at the top of
	the page the parameters that were used to generate these teams. There is
	also some summary statistics about the overall teams. You can use this
	summary to compare which set of teams is better for your class.
	We will be extending on the available summary statistics in the near future. 
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I know if the generated teams are any good?</strong></p>
    <p>In addition to the summary statistics of the team set, our app provides
	visual analytics to help you quickly inspect how well a team adheres to
	the criteria you selected for forming teams. When you view a team set, you
	can select the attributes that you wish to use as part of this diagnosis,
	the type of graph to use for an attribute, and click "Visualize". Each
	team will have appear with the set of visual analytics. You can also
	expand a team and the same visual analytics will appear for each
	individual team member. This will also help you detect if a specific
	member should be moved to a different team or not.

    <p><strong>Does Teamable Analytics work with other learning management
	systems?</strong></p>
    <p>Teamable Analytics interacts with the learning management
	system via the LTI protocol. As such, our app can be tweaked so that it
	works with another LMS that also uses the LTI protocol. At present, we
	have only integrated and tested with the Canvas learning management
	system.</p>
