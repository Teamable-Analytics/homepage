    <h1>FAQ</h1>
    <p><strong>How do I start generating teams for my class?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: You have to first get your course information imported into the
	app, then elicit the necessary preferences from your students, specify any
	project needs you may have, and then you can generate teams. Follow the
	stepper at the top of the app from left to right to walk through each of
	these steps one at a time.
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I import my course information into the app?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: Go to Step 1 labeled "Sections". If you haven't already done
	so, the app will ask you to import the sections and students into the app.
	If you're not sure, you can always import the data again. Also, if you
	think you have new students who registered late to your course, you can
	click import again and that student will also be added to the app.
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I view the list of students in the course?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: Go to Step 2 labeled "Students". All the imported student
	information will show up there. You can always come back to this tab after
	the teams are formed to search which team a particular student belongs to.
	</p>

    <p><strong>What are "Attributes"?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>Something about default attributes</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>Something about data privacy</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>What if I don't have projects in my course but I still want
	students to work in teams?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: You can skip the "Projects" step since this information is
	optional.
	</p>

    <p><strong>How do I define the projects that I need to assign a team to? </strong></p>
    <p>Answer: xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>What if I want to assign multiple teams to a project?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: You can first define the project, then clone it, and give it a
	different name. Then when you generate teams, one team will be assigned to
	the original project and another team will be assigned to the cloned
	project.
	</p>

    <p><strong>Can I modify project requirements after the teams have been
	generated?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: Unfortunately, once the teams have been generated, you cannot
	modify the requirements. If you need to change the projects, you will need
	to create a new project set with new projects, and then re-generate the
	teams.
	</p>

    <p><strong>Why do I have to build surveys?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: The purpose of the survey is to help you elicit student
	characteristics and preferences. xxx
	</p>

    <p><strong>Will students use this app to answer the survey?</strong></p>
    <p>Answer: No, once you are done building the survey, you can publish it
	in the learning management system. In Canvas, the published survey will
	show up as a quiz. Students can complete the quiz in Canvas. </p>

    <p>Answer: Teamable Analytics interacts with the learning management

	works with another LMS that also uses the LTI protocol. At present, we
	have only integrated and tested with the Canvas learning management
	system.</p>
